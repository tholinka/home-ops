# Serial Forward

My tubeszb z-wave poe kit quit working (just loops forever with z-wave js ui reporting `Failed to initialize the driver: ZWaveError: Timeout while waiting for an ACK`).

However, it's possible to on a rpi to forward serial from the z-wave pi hat directly to tcp.

This is an archlinuxarm package to do that
