## 💡 Overview

This is a mono repository for my home infrastructure and Kubernetes cluster. I try to adhere to Environment as Code (EaC), Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps practices using tools like [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2), [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate), and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

## <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/refs/heads/master/logo/logo.svg" alt="🌱" width="20" height="20"> Kubernetes

My Kubernetes cluster is deployed with [Talos](https://www.talos.dev). This is a semi-hyper-converged cluster, workloads and block storage are sharing the same available resources on my nodes while I have a separate server with BTRFS for NFS/SMB shares, bulk file storage and backups.

### Core Components

- [actions-runner-controller](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller): Self-hosted Github runners.
- [cert-manager](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager): Creates SSL certificates for services in my cluster.
- [cilium](https://github.com/cilium/cilium): eBPF-based networking.
- [cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared): Enables Cloudflare secure access to routes.
- [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns): Automatically syncs ingress DNS records to Cloudflare and Unifi.
- [external-secrets](https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets): Managed Kubernetes secrets using [Bitwarden Secrets Manager](https://github.com/external-secrets/bitwarden-sdk-server/).
- [rook](https://github.com/rook/rook): Distributed block storage for persistent storage.
- [spegel](https://github.com/spegel-org/spegel): Stateless cluster local OCI registry mirror. No more image pull backoff.
- [volsync](https://github.com/backube/volsync): Automatic backup and recovery of persistent volume claims to NFS and Cloudflare R2. Lose nothing when the cluster blows up!

### GitOps

[Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) watches the clusters in my [kubernetes](./kubernetes/) folder (see Directories below) and makes the changes to my clusters based on the state of my Git repository.

The way Flux works for me here is it will recursively search the `kubernetes/apps` folder until it finds the most top level `kustomization.yaml` per directory and then apply all the resources listed in it. That aforementioned `kustomization.yaml` will generally only have a namespace resource and one or many Flux kustomizations (`ks.yaml`). Under the control of those Flux kustomizations there will be a `HelmRelease` or other resources related to the application which will be applied.

[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) watches my **entire** repository looking for dependency updates, when they are found a PR is automatically created. When some PRs are merged Flux applies the changes to my cluster.

### Directories

This Git repository contains the following directories under [Kubernetes](./kubernetes/).

```sh
📁 kubernetes
├── 📁 apps             # applications
├── 📁 bootstrap        # bootstrap procedures
└── 📁 flux             # flux system configuration
  ├── 📁 components     # re-useable components used by apps
  └── 📁 meta
    └── 📁 repositories # sources for flux, e.g. helm charts
```

### Flux Workflow

This is a high-level look how Flux deploys my applications with dependencies. In most cases a `HelmRelease` will depend on other `HelmRelease`'s, in other cases a `Kustomization` will depend on other `Kustomization`'s, and in rare situations an app can depend on a `HelmRelease` and a `Kustomization`. The example below shows that `mongo` won't be deployed or upgrade until `mongo` and `volsync` are installed and in a healthy state.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A>Kustomization: unifi-mongo] --> |Depends on| B
    B>Kustomization: mongo] --> |Creates| B1
    B1>HelmRelease: mongo] --> |Depends on| B3

    E>Kustomization: snapshot-controller] --> |Creates| E1>Helmrelease: snapshot-controller]
    B3 --> |Depends on| E1
```

## 🌐 Networking

### 🏘️ VLANs

| Name    | ID | CIDR            |
|---------|----|-----------------|
| Default | 0  | 192.168.1.0/24  |
| servers | 20 | 192.168.20.0/24 |
| iot     | 30 | 192.168.30.0/24 |
| guest   | 40 | 192.168.40.0/24 |

### 🌎 DNS

In my cluster there are three instances of [ExternalDNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) running. One syncs the public DNS to `Cloudflare`. The second syncs to `Pi-Hole`, which is the primary internal dns. The third syncs to my `UniFi Gatway Max` using [ExternalDNS webhook provider for UniFi](https://github.com/kashalls/external-dns-unifi-webhook), as a fallback in case the cluster is down. This setup is managed by creating two gateways, `internal` and `external`. `internal` is only exposed internally, whereas `external` is exposed both internally and through `Cloudflare.`

### 🏠 Home DNS

```mermaid
graph TD
  A>internal-external-dns] -->|Updates|D
  C>Answers Request]
  D[PiHole] -->|Blocked, Cluster, or custom hosts|C
  D -->|Forwards other requests|E[DNSCrypt-Proxy]
  E[DNSCrypt-Proxy] -->|Forwards requests to DNSCrypt or DoH resolver|C
```

## ☁️ Cloud Dependencies

While most of my infrastructure and workloads are self-hosted I do rely upon the cloud for certain key parts of my setup. This saves me from having to worry about three things. (1) Dealing with chicken/egg scenarios, (2) services I critically need whether my cluster is online or not and (3) The "hit by a bus factor" - what happens to critical apps (e.g. Email, Password Manager, Photos) that my family relies on when I no longer around.

Alternative solutions to the first two of these problems would be to host a Kubernetes cluster in the cloud and deploy applications like [HCVault](https://www.vaultproject.io/), [Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden), [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh/), and [Gatus](https://gatus.io/); however, maintaining another cluster and monitoring another group of workloads would be more work and probably be more or equal out to the same costs as described below.
